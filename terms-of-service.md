2. Authorized Use and User Obligations
The App is intended solely for authorized posting to X (formerly Twitter) in compliance with all applicable laws and the X Developer Agreement and Policy and X Rules. You agree that: 
You are solely responsible for all content, data, graphics, posts, and information that you upload, post, or transmit through the App ("User Content").
You will not use the App to post any unlawful, harassing, libelous, pornographic, vulgar, defamatory, or otherwise inappropriate content, or to engage in spam or other prohibited activities as defined by X's policies.
You will not interfere with or disrupt the integrity or performance of the App or the X services.

3. User Content Responsibility
You retain all ownership rights in the User Content you post through the App. However, you are entirely responsible for the legality, reliability, and appropriateness of that content. The App is not responsible for reviewing, monitoring, or deleting user-generated content, though we reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms. 
4. Privacy and Data Collection
Your privacy is important to us. The App does not collect or transmit any personal data beyond what is strictly required for its intended function (i.e., authentication tokens and content necessary for posting to X). 
We do not store your X password. We use industry-standard OAuth for authorization.
For detailed information on how we handle data, please refer to our separate Privacy Policy.

The App is provided on an "as-is" and "as-available" basis. We disclaim all warranties, express or implied, including but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We will not be liable for any damages arising from your use of the App, including service interruptions or data loss.
