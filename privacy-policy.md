Privacy Policy
Effective Date: 01/14/26
This Privacy Policy outlines the data handling practices for this application (the "App"), operated by Jeans Beans Coffee™. We are committed to user privacy and transparency. 
1. Data Controller
For any privacy-related questions, you may contact the application developer directly:
Developer Name: Jeannine Elizabeth McSharry
Contact Email: mcsharryjeannine@gmail.com
2. Core Privacy Principle: Local Data Storage 
Our primary commitment is the protection of your data. The core principle of the App's design is the exclusive local storage of all user information. This means that, by design, the App does not collect, upload, or transmit your personal data to any external servers or cloud services operated by the developer or any third parties. 
3. Data Practices and Information Handling
The App handles the following types of information strictly within the confines of your local device: 
User Credentials: All login information, API keys, tokens, and authorization credentials for the X platform (formerly Twitter) are stored securely on your device's local storage.
Content Data: Any content you create, draft, or store within the App (e.g., tweet content, post schedules, saved drafts) remains solely on your device. 
4. Data Usage and Purpose Specification
The credentials mentioned above are used for one purpose only:
Authorized X Posting Only: Your API credentials are used exclusively to authenticate with the X platform's services and to facilitate posting content to your designated X account(s), as explicitly initiated and authorized by you, the user. The developer does not access or use these credentials for any other purpose. 
5. Data Transmission & Third-Party Disclosure
No External Uploads: No data generated or stored within the App is uploaded, transmitted, or backed up to external servers, cloud services, or any third party by the application developer.
User-Initiated Transmission: Data is only transmitted to the X platform when you explicitly use the App's functionalities to post content to your social media account(s). This is a direct transaction between your device and the X platform's servers, not through any intermediary developer server. 
6. User Control and Data Retention 
You retain full control over your data. 
Retention: All data persists only as long as the App is installed on your device and its data has not been cleared.
Deletion: Deleting the App from your device, or clearing the App's data via your device's operating system settings, will permanently erase all locally stored information, including credentials and saved content. The developer has no mechanism to recover this data once deleted from your device. 
7. Acknowledgment and Consent
By installing and using this App, you acknowledge and agree to this strictly local data handling policy. If you do not agree with these practices, your recourse is to discontinue using and uninstall the App. 
8. Policy Updates
We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time. We encourage users to frequently check this policy for any changes. Your continued use of the App following the posting of changes to this policy will be deemed your acceptance of those changes.
